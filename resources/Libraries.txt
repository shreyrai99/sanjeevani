react-router-dom: react router so that we can actually have different routes,
different URLs that we can go to in our project in our front end.
React renders the appropriate information on the DOM using its component structure. 
Client-side routing in React helps to maintain the seamless user experience that a 
typical single-page application promises. This is achieved through an external React library 
called React Router.

of the time make sure you choose Link or Navlink when working with routing
